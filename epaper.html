            <p>For seven decades now, Deccan Herald (DH) has been Karnataka's best-loved newspaper. For the state's
                residents, it is essential reading because it keeps them abreast of everything that's happening in their
                city and their state. But the breadth of its content makes it a national newspaper that happens to be
                headquartered in India's tech capital Bengaluru; it has won plaudits for its coverage of the issues that
                matter in India and its fearless editorials on issues of national importance. The paper is also
                increasingly integrated with its digital offshoots, making it a seamless journey from newspaper to a
                website with a national footprint to high-quality video and podcasts. We're not afraid to experiment: In
                a period of just over a year, we have relaunched the newspaper (with a new masthead), introduced a
                brand-new app and are now coming out with an e-paper-only National Edition. Our core belief, of course,
                doesn't change, that good journalism is journalism for good, and that there's no power like the Power of
                Good.</p>
